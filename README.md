# maze

This is an interactive 3D application where the user has to find the 
exit of a generated maze. This project was created as a study work 
for computergraphics and interactions at the Hochschule Hannover.

For the project build of the project GLEW and GLFW are used. The
model itself is built with the faculty's scene graph library
scg3.
